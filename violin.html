          This concert was played on November 17th, 2019 at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's Symphony Center. For this performance,
          we had the CSO's organ player play with us. I was sitting right behind the concertmaster and it was the
          highest seat I held during my time at CYSO. We also played Serge Koussevitzky's Bass Concerto and Zhou Tian's "Transcend". Because of these pieces,
          I'd say that this program was my favorite out of all of the programs I have played during my time at CYSO.

          My performance for the Junior Division of the Walgreens Violin Competition on December 29, 2018. This was first real solo performance for years
          and it would be a lie to say that I wasn't nervous about it. This did show as I admittedly made a few technical mistakes. Although I did not place at the competition,
          I still received mostly positive feedback from the judges and enjoyed the experience very much.

          This was a performance for Whitney Young Orchestra's "Diverse Voices Project". The goal was to split up into small ensemble groups and perform
          pieces from underrepresented composers. This meant that we could not play pieces from composers such as Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Mozart, etc as they are classified as
          dead white male composers. Some of the composers the ensemble groups ended up choosing included Maddalena Lombardini-Sirmen, Aldolphus Hailstork, Samuel Coleridge Taylor, and
          George Walker.

          During my first year in Whitney Young's Chamber Orchestra, we performed at "The Midwest Clinic". It was a conference that lasted several days in December that allowed bands and orchestras from
          around the world to promote diversity in the musical performance realm. This performance was one of my most cherished memories from the orchestra not only because I was lucky enough to have a solo,
          but also because of the collective effort that took place in preparation for the performance. Altogether, it took us almost a semester of rehearsing, and during that time we were instructed by Whitney Young's band director, 
          Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestra's head director, as well as one of the composers for one of the pieces we played.

          This performance was made during the Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestra's 2020 Gala which was held at the Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago. We played a multitude of pieces such as George Gerswhin's "Rhapsody In Blue", Edith Piaf's "La Vie en Rose", 
          and Debussy's "Clair de Lune" but "An American In Paris" by George Gershwin was for sure my favorite piece of the night. We also had Chicago-based singer Opal Staples sing for some of the pieces such as Etta James' "At Last". My favorite memory 
          from the night was when an auction was held and there was one person in particular who was always promised to have had the very last bid on an item, only for the host to keep breaking the promise by asking a further bid. I could tell he was not 
          very pleased but he sure did his best to hide it.

        <div class="description">
          2019 was the year CYSO introduced the CORE Orchestra, an ensemble that was dedicated to playing "classical" music. This category of music includes the likes of Mendelssohn, Mozart, Bach, etc. Because of my high seat in the Symphony Orchestra,
          I was selected to participate in the CORE Orchestra. It was also in this ensemble where I experienced blind auditions for the first time. Unfortunately, during the blind auditions, I somehow managed to play the wrong excerpt. Because of that, I got a few
          laughs out of people and got the director to come in with a confused look on his face as I finally realized my mistake. Despite that and the extra hour and a half of rehearsals, I had a fun time playing with the CORE Orchestra. It's a shame that we never
          got to play the Mendelssohn Scottish Symphony for the second semester performance due to the rise of Covid-19.
